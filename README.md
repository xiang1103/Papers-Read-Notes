# Papers-Read and their notes 
A list of AI research papers I read, in the field of LLM, Generative Models, Lifelong ML. I generally found writing notes down help me better understand and remember a paper.  
 
I'm using this repo to be a central hub to compile their notes for future references. (Also because I'm running out of cloud storage) 
  
## Methods of reading papers 
Some of my personal ways for reading papers and taking notes for references. These are from my personal experiences and which worked for me. 
- Before reading a paper, compile a list of questions you have (think like an amateur) and separately with your domain knowledge. Keep asking these questions as you read a paper and look for answers as you read. These are some sample must ask questions: 
    - What is the problem the paper tries to solve? Why does this problem matter? 
    - How does the paper solve this problem? 
    - What are the results of this paper? 
    - Why does the methods work? 
    - How can we use the result from this paper? 
    - How does this paper connect with other methods you know in the field? 
    - What is a problem/drawback of the method? How can we try to modify the methodology (code/theory to adjust it)? 
- 3 Pass methods: 
    - First pass look for the general high-level ideas: what this paper does, what is the context, what is their contribution, what is the goal/task they are trying to solve, what model they used, conclusions ... 
    - Second pass: Depending on how relevant this paper is, you can start looking for the technical details such as the specific training methods, metrics used, or any other technical details that would answer the questions you have 
    - Third pass: This is the last pass to get almost every missed detail that you need. Usually I do this third pass on papers that I really need to understand/use as reference. 
- Write a quick summary of the take away of this paper (summarize in a few sentences from problem --> how to solve --> results --> takeaway)
- Write down other ideas/details that you got from the 3 pass method or which answer your questions. 
  
I can not guarantee that my understanding of the paper is correct. There might be mistakes. But I try to mitigate them. There could be some redundancy inside the notes. And they could be a little bit disorganized.  

Though not meant to be instructive, hopefully my notes can give you some guidance as well if you are trying to understand some papers which I read too.
